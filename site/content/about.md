Mikael Rosbacke

I'm an independent software developer specializing in C/C++ development in Linux / microcontroller environments. I use my own company 
[Akaza AB](http://www.akaza.se/ "Company of Mikael Rosbacke.") to facilitate consulting work in these areas.

I use this website to share various thoughts regarding software development. I used to have a blogg at my companys site, but moved it here.
